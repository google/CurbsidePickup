Curbside Pick-up Framework!

A simple small business solution to enable curbside pick-up.

################## What is it? ##################

A simple, free Google Sheets and Google Forms solution to help Canadian small businesses enable curbside pickup for their products during the COVID-19 pandemic. The solution requires minimum setup and technical maintenance. 
In three simple steps, businesses can embed the dynamically generated Google Form link on their website or social media channels.  Businesses can then receive orders and communicate with their customers.

################## Who is it for? ##################

Any business that is looking to pivot their customer strategy during the evolving COVID-19 situation. By using curbside order pickup, customers can place orders online, and then collect them from the curbside of the establishment without entering the store. 
By automating this process, businesses will have clarity on when to expect customers, and manage customer flow for pick-up. 
This workflow is also helpful for not-for-profits that are requesting items in need, and can manage schedules and delivery drop-offs.
